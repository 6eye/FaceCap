     Building the
    FaceCap v1.3.2 
 --------------------
 (C) 2012 Xantus S.A.


* REQUIREMENTS *

To build this package you'll need:
- OpenCV (2.3.2)
- Autodesk Maya 2011 (2011.5-x64)
- Linux worsktation 
- gcc,pkg-config etc.. and some skills :)


* BUILDING *

Unpack the package (already done if you read this):
 
    $ tar -xzvf FaceCap-1.3.2.tgz 


Copy libmocap.a from your Maya lib directory to FaceCap directory. This 
static library is needed to link the binary.

    $ cp /usr/autodesk/maya2011.5-x64/lib/libmocap.a FaceCap-1.3.2/


Enter the FaceCap directory and run build_all.sh script. 
If all the dependencies are meet you should get output like this:

    $ cd FaceCap-1.3.2
    $ ./build_all.sh
    [+] Maya library found.
    [*] FC_marker.c
    [*] FC_math.c
    [*] FC_maya.c
    [*] FC_opencv.c
    [*] main.c
    :[ FC_marker.o FC_math.o FC_maya.o FC_opencv.o main.o ]:
    [+] Done.

Seeing "Done" means you are ready to capture. If "Failed" then use skills 
mentioned in *REQUIREMENTS* :) As result of building process the binary named "test" 
will be created in FaceCap directory.


* EXTRA INFO *

You will probably need to change FC_maya.h file in order to get proper path for Maya headers:
	#include <maya/mocapserver.h>
	#include <maya/mocapserial.h>
... or you can add the -I/usr/autodesk/maya2011.5-x64/include parameter inside build_all.sh script 
... or just link /usr/autodesk/maya2011.5-x64/include/maya into /usr/include.
